This is a tap for Mac Homebrew. The formulae in it provide the cowsay utility, along with alternate implementations of it and auxiliary packages that work with it.

This tap is part of the cowsay-apj project, a modern fork of cowsay. The main apjanke/cowsay project repo is at [https://github.com/apjanke/cowsay](https://github.com/apjanke/cowsay).

For info about Mac Homebrew, see [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).
